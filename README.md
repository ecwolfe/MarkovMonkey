MarkovMonkey
============

Markov Monkey is a random text generator that produces new randomized text from a source file. The program uses three things to determine how to form the new file: A source file to read, A value named k that determins degree of simlarity between the source file and the new file (with 3 being same letter as source text, 5-6 uses same words and names, +10 being almost the same text), and the length the new file should be. While the text produced can at times seem to make sense it is rare that any new text produced has correct grammar.
